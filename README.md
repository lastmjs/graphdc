# GraphDC

GraphQL is perfectly poised to capitalize on blockchain innovations. With its simple client syntax and its ability to resolve queries across arbitrary data sources, it is possible to plug decentralized computation and storage solutions into GraphQL. This will offer a seamless entry point for GraphQL applications into the world of decentralized computing and storage. No more complicated infrastructure, no more scaling and uptime issues, just pure client-side GraphQL queries that resolve against an unstoppable decentralized backend.

## Roadmap

The order is intended to be prioritized and chronological, but is subject to change.

- [ ] Minimum viable GraphQL implementation running on the EVM
- [ ] Full GraphQL implementation running on the EVM
- [ ] Minimum viable auto-generating data access layer running on the EVM (see [Prisma](https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma))
- [ ] Full auto-generating data access layer running on the EVM (see [Prisma](https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma))
- [ ] Authentication and authorization of data stored on the blockchain
- [ ] Simple yet powerful developer tooling
- [ ] Optimization
