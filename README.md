# GraphDC

GraphQL is perfectly poised to capitalize on blockchain innovations. With its simple client syntax and its ability to resolve queries across arbitrary data sources, it is possible to plug decentralized computation and storage solutions into GraphQL. This will offer a seamless entry point for GraphQL applications into the world of decentralized computing and storage. No more complicated infrastructure, no more scaling and uptime issues, just pure client-side GraphQL queries that resolve against an unstoppable decentralized backend.
