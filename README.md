# GraphDC

Decentralized GraphQL is an implementation of GraphQL running on blockchain virtual machines. Its code literally runs directly on the blockchain. The goal is to create an unstoppable GraphQL backend with 100% uptime, infinite scalability, amazing security and privacy, and extremely simplified infrastructure and maintenance.

## Roadmap

The order is intended to be prioritized and chronological, but is subject to change.

- [ ] Minimum viable GraphQL implementation running on the EVM
- [ ] Full GraphQL implementation running on the EVM
- [ ] Minimum viable auto-generating data access layer running on the EVM (see [Prisma](https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma))
- [ ] Full auto-generating data access layer running on the EVM (see [Prisma](https://github.com/prismagraphql/prisma))
- [ ] Authentication and authorization of data stored on the blockchain
- [ ] Simple yet powerful developer tooling
- [ ] Optimization

## Justification

### The Internet is decentralized

The exchange of data across the internet is decentralized, which brings a host of benefits. As a whole it has 100% uptime, it has scaled incredibly to handle most every application we’ve thrown at it, and it is extremely fault-tolerant. It was built to survive disasters, and it has.

### The Web is not decentralized

The storage of data across the internet’s greatest domain of applications, the Web, is not decentralized. Content hosted on the Web is most often stored behind the proprietary infrastructure of large companies. This centralization brings a host of issues. Uptime, scalability, and fault-tolerance is subject to their limitations. You may trust them, but in the end that’s all you can rely on. They are a central point of failure.

### Decentralize the Web

New decentralized technologies are coming out to solve these problems. Using worldwide peer-to-peer networks, these technologies will democratize the world’s resources to create large decentralized and distributed virtual machines, file systems, and databases. These technologies offer applications the possibility of 100% uptime, infinite scalability, and extremely low maintenance.

### Decentralize GraphQL

GraphQL is perfectly poised to capitalize on these innovations. With its simple client syntax and its ability to resolve queries across arbitrary data sources, it is possible to plug these decentralized computation and storage solutions into GraphQL. This will offer a seamless entry point for GraphQL applications into the world of decentralized computing and storage. No more complicated infrastructure, no more scaling and uptime issues, just pure client-side GraphQL queries that resolve against an unstoppable decentralized backend.
